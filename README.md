# Todo App 
A simple full-stack Todo application built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. 
This app allows users to register, log in, and manage their daily tasks.
The backend is deployed on **Render**, and the frontend is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

### Live Demo

> [!important]
> This project uses Render free hosting to deploy the backend. If the backend has been idle,
> the first request can take up to 50 seconds or more to wake it up. Subsquent requests will respond much faster.
